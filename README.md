### HackTheBurgh Project
#### Created by: Steven Chang, Alexandra Purcarea, Pradnesh Sanderan and Jonathan Gustafsson Frennert. 

Android application written in native Java within 24 hrs for sustainable travelling via Google Maps, OpenTripMap and OpenWeatherMap API integrations. This application curates the most sustainable recreational activities that tourists can get in their vicinity, even considering the weather! We aim to make this the only app tourists will ever need.

#### Description
When travellers first come to an unknown city, they probably won't be that familiar with the local weather which might potentially affect their travel plan (eg. climbing Arthur's Seat when it's rainy is not ideal), so our app can detect the climate based on three indexes: weather, temperature and wind speed to recommend the suitable attractions (categorized as indoor and outdoor) for travellers to visit.

#### Challenge
WE ONLY HAVE ONE ANDROID PHONE AND IT'S GPS IS BROKEN SO WE CANNOT DETECT OUR EXACT LOCATION WHICH WE THOUGHT IT'S A BUG IN THE PROGRAM AND SPEND HOURS ON MEANINGLESS DEBUGGING

#### TODO: 
- [ ] merge side branch to incorporate mindful banner at the start of the app 
- [ ] add 'heat map' functionality (changing the color of the markers)
- [ ] improve markdown
- [ ] add information for buidings using web scraper (?)
